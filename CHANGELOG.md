## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- Auto-ref dedup used className strings, causing sections with identical classes to be skipped. Now uses WeakSet for proper element identity checks.
- Toolbar buttons now reflect the configured default mode on first render instead of always highlighting Icons.
- Toast notification positioned correctly when toolbar is placed in top-right or top-left corners.
- WordPress settings page missing from admin menu (stale plugin zip contained truncated PHP).
- `wordpress.md` install instructions referenced "Settings → General" instead of "Settings → Debug Toolbar".

### Changed

- Minimum PHP requirement updated from 7.4 to 8.1.
- WordPress plugin zip filename now includes version number (`seguru-debug-toolbar-wp-v1.1.1.zip`).
- Build script reads version from `package.json` and injects it into `readme.txt` dynamically.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Class-to-ref converter** — Converts CSS classes prefixed with `dataref-` into `data-ref` attributes on page load. Works with every page builder including free tiers. Enabled via WP settings or `sdtConfig.classConverter`.
- **Auto-ref** — Automatically generates `data-ref` values for major section elements based on page slug and position. Detects Elementor, Bricks, Oxygen, Breakdance, and HTML5 `<section>` tags. Enabled via WP settings or `sdtConfig.autoRef`.
- **Page Builders settings card** in the WP admin settings page with toggles for both features.
- WP-CLI support for the two new options: `sdt_class_converter` and `sdt_auto_ref`.
- Breakdance builder detection in auto-ref selectors.
- Interactive demo page (`test/demo.html`) with feature flag toggles and test sections for class converter, auto-ref, and mixed scenarios.

### Changed

- `refresh()` API now re-runs both the class converter and auto-ref before scanning for labels.
- `page-builders.md` rewritten to lead with built-in features (class converter, auto-ref) instead of manual-only instructions.
- `wordpress.md` updated with Page Builders settings section and WP-CLI commands for new options.
- `wp-settings-page.md` IA diagram and option storage table updated with new fields.
- README features list updated with class converter and auto-ref.
